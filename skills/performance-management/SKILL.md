## Core Concepts

### Rating Scales
- **Needs Improvement**: Below expectations, needs support
- **Meets Expectations**: Performing at level, solid contributor
- **Exceeds Expectations**: Above level, significant impact
- **Far Exceeds**: Exceptional, role model, organizational impact

### SMART Goals
- **S**pecific: Clear and well-defined
- **M**easurable: Quantifiable outcomes
- **A**chievable: Realistic but challenging
- **R**elevant: Aligned with business/team goals
- **T**ime-bound: Clear timeline

### Key Results (OKRs)
- Quantifiable
- Ambitious but achievable
- Time-bound (typically quarterly)
- 0.0-1.0 scale (0.7 is good, 1.0 is stretch)
- Outcome-focused, not activity-focused

### Performance Dimensions
