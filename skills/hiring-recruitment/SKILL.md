→ Technical skills alone don't make good teams
→ Balance technical with soft skills

**Mistake: Premature hiring**
→ Rush to fill positions with wrong candidates
→ Better to wait for right person

**Mistake: Biased interviews**
→ Use structured interviews
→ Diverse interview panels
→ Clear criteria

**Mistake: Not assessing learning ability**
→ Look for curious, adaptable candidates
→ Ability to learn > current knowledge
